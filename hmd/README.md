# Head Mounted Displays (HMD)

It is my belief the keyboard/mouse as inputs for humans has long overstayed their welcome. No offense to the homies at PARC, you did what you could at the time,
but we need to move on and when I look around in 2020 only the long-awaited advent of immersive technology has me excited the time has finally come to push on.

Currently I'm not sure there is an ideal solution. HMD, which currently I will confess in my mind mostly refer to eyewear, are progressive, in that they are 
the next step for us to move passed the keyboard/mouse but in no way do they satisfy all requirements for an ideal technology. There are concessions that we
as humans must realize and accept. When we compare the usage of a modern computer monitor to a pair of eyeglasses, I prefer the latter. When we compare the use
of a keyboard/mouse to "natural interfaces" - the movement of the human body, the voice of a human, etc. these are natural ways we already communicate as humans,
I prefer natural interfaces. 

So these are the areas of focus for my development, within HMD:
- Build concepts to replace the modern computer monitor with eyewear
- Build concepts to replace the keyboard/mouse with natural interfaces
