a safe space to create, apart from the destructive ideas of modern technology and thought.
---
The year is 2020 and i have had enough of corporations driving the engineering of the modern World. 
I grew up "online", the first generation to do so. I've seen the progression from the early 90s to 2020 and i am not amused.

Perhaps over time I will explain my contention, if you do not share the same disdain for technology in 2020 then we will just
have to part there for now. I have work to do. I have decided to make it my life's mission to build new ideas for humanity's use
of technology.

This starts with 3 simple principles, technology should be designed: 
- **to help humans feel safe**
- **to connect humanity**
- **to empower humanity**

Nowhere in this list are things like "shareholder profits", "corporate interests", "surveillance of the state". 

I believe most importantly in: GIVING THE POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE. I suppose that makes me a Public Enemy, for now.

I have radical ideas about how things should work, I would hope anyone living in today's World would also share this ideal. If you
look around and you are complacent with everything you see, look deeper, think deeper, step back and truly observe what is happening.

I will try my best to not let my raw, emotional energy out into my writing. I will try to focus this energy on changing what I hate,
and that starts with (3) major areas of research, in no particular order: 
- HMD - Head Mounted Displays
- HCI - Human Computer Interaction
- MMI - Man-Machine Interfaces

Now, mind you, there will be more areas of interest added to this list over time but I think I will start there.

"i'm trying to think deeply about what it means to be a human and radically rethink the way humanity uses technology. i am not perfect and i am just trying to be a better human being, don't judge me too harshly. stick around, i promise i'm not *that* crazy."
